* Phase 1 Deliverables (Target Date: Week of Sept 23) - Initial interaction with motors
  - Circuit diagrams (or photos), parts descriptions, and notes for basic non-ROS-control interfacing with motors from Raspberry PI
  - Link to source code to run on PI to do basic interface
  - Description of set up, running, and issues to address.  Identify any particularly challenging aspects that future projects should be aware of 

* Phase 2 Deliverables - Motor Interface via ROS Control (Target Date: Week of Sept 30)



## URDF

* Deliverable: Completed URDF for 890 version of the robot, with notes about how the URDF differs from the AR version 
* Target Date for first draft: Week of Sept 23
